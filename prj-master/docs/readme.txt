Got Code Style Guide from : https://github.com/ribot/android-guidelines/blob/master/project_and_code_guidelines.md

Guide that we do not follow :
@ 2.25: "If the condition and the body fit on one line and that line is shorter than the max line length, then braces are not required, e.g." --> We put braces for every if conditions.
@ 2.21: "Private, non-static field names start with m. Private, static field names start with s."
--> We do not put m and s before our class attributes' names.
